            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                On this blog, I'll introduce you to the musical that some 
                Cotuca' students performed on this Tuesday (April 1st) in the Salão Nobre, where 
                other students could come and see it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The musical is an interdisciplinary project for the 
                second year of high school that integrates
                the subjects English and Physical Education.
                The teenagers are divided into groups and choose a song
                that they want to present.
            </p> 
            <p>
                In this edition, the group I'll talk about chose
                the music "Little Wolf" from the musical "Epic", 
                which references Greek mythology.
            </p>

            <h2>Epic</h2>
            <img src="capa album epic.webp" id="img">
            <p>
                In mythology, there are some epics, a literary genre 
                characterized by narrating great deeds. In Greek, the 
                Odyssey is one of the main epics, attributed to the 
                Greek poet Homer.
                Tells the Odysseus (or Ulisses)'s journey, back to 
                home (Ithaca), where his wife Penelope and his son 
                Telemachus wait for him, after the Trojan War, facing 
                gods and monsters.

                <p></p>
                Knowing this, Jorge Rivera-Herrans created, initially 
                as a thesis, "Epic", a musical adaption of the Odyssey.

                <br>
                
                The project began in 2019 and gained popularity in 2021 
                on TikTok. The first part, "The Troy Saga", was '
                released in
                2022, followed by "The Cyclops Saga (2023) and 
                "The Ocean Saga (2023)". Only in August 2024, was released 
                "The Wisdom Saga".

                <p></p>
                In this last saga, Telemachus, now 20 years old,
                fights to protect his mother from suitors. Athena 
                intervenes and, as looking for answers about Odysseus,
                discover that he is stuck with Calipso. To libert him,
                Athena challenges Zeus and need to convince five Olympian
                gods, culminating in the confrontation between she 
                and Zeus.

            <h2>Little Wolf</h2>
            <p>
                In this project, we chose, within the context of "Epic", 
                the song "Little Wolf", which is part of "The Wisdom 
                Saga", where, specifically, Telemachus, referring to 
                a small wolf, faces the suitor Antinous to defend his 
                mother's honor, but ends up being beaten. Athena, 
                goddess of wisdom, in disguise, intervenes and saves 
                him. After the fight, Telemachus asks why she helped 
                him, and Athena reflects on her past with Odysseus, 
                showing regret.

            <h2>Production</h2>

            <h4>Song Choice</h4>
            <p>
                The group was free to decide which song to perform and,
                after a few suggestions, Clara suggested "Little Wolf" and
                everyone agreed. The connection with Greek mythology caught our attention,
                in addition to the fact that this story was portrayed in such a modern way.
            </p>

            <h4>Rehearsal and challenges</h4>
            <p>
                The teachers set aside a few weeks of rehearsal during 
                the classes, allowing the group to practice their 
                performance and choreography. At first, there were 
                challenges with how to put it into practice realistically 
                without getting hurt. In addition, adjusting the timing 
                of the music and the movement on stage took a lot of 
                effort, and no one was confident. However, in the end, 
                with a lot of preparation, the group gained confidence 
                and improved their performance.
            </p>

            <h4>Costume</h4>
            <img src="figurino.png" id="img">
            <p>
                The costumes were thought to reflect the 
                epic atmosphere of the musical, 
                with light white clothes, open shoes, 
                gold or silver accessories and capes. 
                The pieces were improvised with clothes 
                that the students already had, such as 
                white pants, shirts and skirts, as well 
                as sandals. The tiara, an accessory that 
                one of the members already had, was a detail 
                that made the look easier. 
                Unfortunately, the cape was a difficult item 
                to find, requiring more effort and adaptation 
                to ensure that all the characters had costumes 
                that were consistent with the musical's proposal.

            <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
            <p>
                Between the rehearsals and the presentation, several funny 
                situations happened. While interviewing them, I made 
                some discoveries:
            </p>
            <br>

            <h5>
                Mariana (Writer):
            </h5>
            <p>
                - Clara, what would you say was the funniest moment in the production?
            </p>

            <br>
            <h5>
                Clara (Athena):
            </h5>
            <p>
                - One of the funniest moments
                was when Júlio, when Athena entered unexpectedly,
                made an exaggeratedly shocked face, making everyone laugh.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h5>
                Mariana (Writer):
            </h5>
            <p>
                - However, Julio doesn't agree with this. What do you say, Julio?
            </p>

            <br>
            <h5>
                Júlio (Telemachus):
            </h5>
            <p>
                - I would say it was really funny when I punched Eduardo (Antinous)
                frozen and he fell to the ground, it was hard to keep a straight 
                face during that moment.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h5>
                Mariana (Writer):
            </h5>
            <p>
                - What did you think of the musical experience?
            </p>

            <br>
            <h5>
                Clara (Athena):
            </h5>
            <p>
                - It was very tiring and even a little stressful at 
                times, but it's really cool to see the results and 
                really like what you did.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h5>
                Júlio (Telemachus):
            </h5>
            <p>
                - Overall, I didn't think it was that great. In the end, 
                it might be kind of fun, but besides having to present 
                it to a lot of people, many classes are used for this, 
                which means that we don't end up getting as much 
                pedagogical benefit as we would from normal classes. 
                So the negative points end up outweighing the positive 
                ones in my opinion.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h5>
                Lorrayne (Battle spectators):
            </h5>
            <p>
                - As much as the results are fun to watch,
                I think there are other more productive and efficient ways
                to learn English. The time it takes to prepare and
                the actual impact of the work is not worth the effort.
            </p>

            </h5>
            <p>
                - For you, what was the hardest part of all this?
            </p>

            <br>
            <h5>
                Eduardo (Antinous):
            </h5>
            <p>
                - Probably adapt the fight scenes.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h5>
                Júlio (Telemachus):
            </h5>
            <p>
                - Apart from presenting, I think it was planning the choreography and
                remembering what to do.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h5>
                Clara (Athena):
            </h5>
            <p>
                - The hardest part was putting together the choreography, 
                for sure, especially the fights.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h5>
                Lorrayne (Battle spectators):
            </h5>
            <p>
                - The nervousness of the presentation.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <p>
                In the end, everyone had their own experience with the musical.
